        A)
        When one operand is an int and the other is a double, Java creates a new temporary value that is the double
        version of the int operand. For example, suppose that we are adding dd + ii where ii is an int variable.
        Suppose the value of ii is 3. Java creates a temporary value 3.0 that is the corresponding double value.

        Can you add a string and an int?
        When you add a string and an integer together, it performs "String concatenation", where it's converting your
        integer into a string and sticking it on the end of the other string. So your result will be the first
        string with the characters 12 stuck on after it.
